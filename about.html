            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Dry Oar Whitewater Rafting began as a small, family-run operation with a single raft
                and a big dream: to share our love of the river with others. Over the years, we have
                grown into a trusted outfitter, guiding thousands of guests down some of the most
                beautiful and exciting rivers in the region. Our guides are experienced, certified,
                and passionate about what they do, and many of them started out just like our guests—
                a little nervous at first, but eager for adventure. From day one, our focus has been
                on safety, stewardship of the environment, and genuine hospitality on and off the water.
